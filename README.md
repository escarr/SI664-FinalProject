Milestone 1: Describe Your Project

I want to build a web application for students to sell their tickets to one another for various sporting events. My motivation for doing so is that when someone currently wants to buy or sell a ticket, they will usually post on Facebook. However, from my experiences with this system, there seems to be a problem with actually connecting sellers with buyers as it is difficult to sort through the numerous posts.

Therefore, my idea is to build a web application that resembles Craigslist, but is solely a platform for students to sell and buy tickets from one another. In terms of layout, I want to organize the tickets by both sport (ex. Football, Basketball, etc.) and section of the stadium (ex. 26, 27, etc.). In order to do so, students selling theit ticket will post their ticket under one of these categories with information about the row, seat, price, preferred payment method (ex. Cash, Venmo, etc.) and information about where is convenient for them to meet up and exchange the ticket. Then, students looking for tickets can go to the sport and section they want and look through the tickets sorted by price. If they are interested in the ticket, they can comment. In order to either post a ticket or comment on a ticket, the user must be logged in to the site.
